Installation
------------
This is a very rough installation guide for Ubuntu 14.04 or a derived distribution.
First, install basic development packages, and a few libraries:
  sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core cmake automake libtool libboost-all-dev

Then install OpenCV 3.0:
  git clone http://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
  cd opencv
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ..
  make && sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig
  cd ..

As well as libfreenect2:
    git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2
    cd libfreenect2/depends
    ./install_ubuntu.sh
    cd ..
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make && sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ../..

We have everything we need. Go back to the Gifbox directory and do:
  ./autogen.sh && ./configure
  make && sudo make install
